[Generator](https://github.com/Zzzul/generator) is a Laravel-based open-source toolkit for building basic needs for administration interface setup like Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It's the minimalistic template or a starting point for developing CMS system, admin panel, or any other web application that requires CRUD functionality.

## The Reason
We have a bit of time to build <s>master</s> main data over and over again, therefore this package may let you focus on your core features application, Instead, you might use that time to sleep, play video games, or, since it's Ramadhan, pray to Allah ﷻ and Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

## Who We Are
